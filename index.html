        <h3>Educational Goals</h3>
        <p class=" paragraph">I am so excited to be here at <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Dallas College</span> studying web
            development! My first goal is to get my associate's
            degree. I would really love to learn all that is possible to learn here at <span
                style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Dallas College</span> so that I am ready
            to start my new career after graduation.</p>

        <h3>Professional Goals</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">I would love to work somewhere after graduating from <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Dallas
                College</span> that will allow me to continue building on the skills I will
            have gathered in school. Once I have gained more real world experience, my goal is to start building a
            client base so that I can work one-on-one with clients to build and maintain their websites. </p>
